💪 Awesome — here is a **full README.md** template for your GitHub repo, with all **Blind 75 problems**, neatly categorized, and with checkboxes ✅ so you can tick them off as you solve them.

This version assumes you’ll write solutions in a folder structure like this:

```
/
├── Arrays/
│   └── two-sum.js
├── TwoPointers/
│   └── valid-palindrome.js
├── SlidingWindow/
│   └── …
├── README.md
```

The solution links in the README already point to the corresponding folders & filenames, so you just create the files there as you solve.
